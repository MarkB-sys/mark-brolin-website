        Mark Brolin is a geopolitical and geo-economic strategist who supports senior leaders with decision-ready analysis in periods of volatility. Combining evidence-based research with insights from behavioural science, he identifies the institutional and cognitive biases that often distort judgement and helps organisations regain clarity, proportion and timing. Known for a pragmatic "realist-optimist" stance, he evaluates both risks and opportunities with equal discipline — translating global change into actionable strategy.

      <p class="lead">
        Mark holds a degree from the Stockholm School of Economics and has worked in the Swedish Foreign Ministry, Nasdaq/OMX, and Cantor Fitzgerald. His transition to geopolitics and geoeconomics was shaped by the events of September 11, when he lost 658 colleagues. He has since worked with business leaders, policy specialists, research institutes, and think tanks across three continents.
